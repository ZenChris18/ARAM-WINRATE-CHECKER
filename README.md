 # ARAM WINRATE CHECKER
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

Libraries Used
1. dotenv - Used this library for security purposes. Need to hide Keys that i don't want to share to the public
2. OS - in order to access the .env file and get the data.
3. requests - to extract the dict in a json file. 

This is my final project to conclude the CS50 Introduction to programming with python course.

This project named "ARAM winrate checker" is a tool to check your winrate in the gamemode ARAM in League of legends(LOL).  




# isinstance() is a built-in function used to check if an object is an instance of a specified class or its subclasses.
# It returns True if the object is an instance of the class or a subclass of it, otherwise, it returns False.
# Syntax: isinstance(object, class)
#   - object: The object you want to check.
#   - class: The class or type you want to check against.
# Example: isinstance(5, int) will return True because 5 is an instance of the int class.
# Example: isinstance("hello", str) will return True because "hello" is an instance of the str class.
